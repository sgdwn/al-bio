## Monomers and Polymers  
:::note Definition
Monomer -- the smaller subunits making up larger polymers
:::  
:::note Definition
Polymer -- molecules made from a large number of monomers joined together

Condensation Reactions  
- Join monomers together into larger molecules, releasing water  
- Monosaccharides → Disaccharides → Polysaccharides: glycosidic bonds formed  
- Amino acids → Polypeptides: peptide bonds  
- Glycerol + fatty acids → Triglycerides: ester bonds  
:::  
:::note Definition
Condensation Reaction  
Break down larger molecules, using water
:::  

## Carbohydrates  
- Made up of monosaccharides (monomers of carbohydrates)  
- Common monosaccharides - glucose, galactose, fructose  
- Disaccharides  
	o Formed by condensation reaction of 2 monosaccharides  
	o Maltose → Glucose + Glucose  
	o Sucrose → Glucose + Fructose  
	o Lactose → Glucose + Galactose  
### Two Isomers:  
α-glucose: Carbon atom 1 has hydrogen pointing up, and hydroxyl group pointing down  
β-glucose: Carbon atom 1 has hydrogen and hydroxyl groups flipped

- Polysaccharides  
	o Formed by condensation of many monosaccharides  
	o Glycogen → condensation of α-glucose  
	o Starch → condensation of α-glucose  
	o Cellulose → condensation of β-glucose  
- Structure of Glycogen  
	o Energy store in animals  
	o Highly branched structure, coiled – so compact  
	o Unable to diffuse out of cells, so stays where it is needed until energy is required  
- Structure of Cellulose  
	o Unbranched, linear chains  
	o Used in plant cell wall – provides rigidity to plants  
	o Fibres group together to form microfibrils – hydrogen bonds (strength in large numbers)  
- Structure of Starch  
	o Forms granules – unable to move out of cells it is formed in – doesn’t have to diffuse far, so reasonably quick access to energy  
	o Branched chains, coiled – compact
	
## Lipids  
- Triglycerides  
	o Glycerol + 3 fatty acid tails  
	o Form oils, waxes, fats  
	o Hydrophobic – do not mix with water  
- Phospholipids  
	o Form the cell wall – phospholipid bilayer  
	o Phosphate + glycerol + 2 fatty acid tails  
	o Polar molecules – phosphate head is hydrophilic (water loving) // fatty acid tails are hydrophobic (water hating)  
- Fatty acids  
	o Saturated – all carbon atoms have single bonds – with the maximum number of hydrogens possible  
	o Unsaturated  
:::tip Key Point
**Monounsaturated**  
	1 pair of carbon atoms have a double bond  
	removes 2 hydrogens, causing a kink in the chain  
:::  
:::tip Key Point
**Polyunsaturated**  
	more than 1 pair of carbon atoms have a double bond  
	removes more than 2 hydrogens  
	causes many kinks in the chain  
	have less energy than unsaturated fatty acids

## Proteins  
- Made up of amino acids  
- Amine group: NH2 Carboxyl group: COOH  
- R group – the side chain causing the amino acid to be unique  
- Dipeptides – condensation of two amino acids  
- Polypeptides – condensation of many amino acids  
- Proteins can be made up of multiple polypeptide chains  
:::note Primary Structure
order of amino acids – polypeptide chain  
:::  
:::note Secondary Structure
α-helix or β-pleated sheet – formed by hydrogen bonds between R-groups  
:::  
:::note Tertiary Structure
further coiling of α-helix / β-pleated sheet – more compact  
:::
:::note Quaternary Structure
linking together of multiple tertiary structure polypeptide chains  
:::   
- Hydrogen bonds – hold together the polypeptide chains in quaternary structure  
- Ionic bonds – join together amino acids into polypeptide chain  
- Disulphide bridges – strong bonds between R-groups holding α-helix / β-pleated sheet together

## Enzymes  
- Lower the activation energy of the reaction it catalyses  
### Lock and Key model 
- Substrate fits perfectly in the enzyme  
- No explanation as to how the enzyme catalyses the reaction  
<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/74820599/111035484-b7a12080-8412-11eb-8149-d32e3e2de207.png" alt="lock and key diagram" width="25%" />[^2]

### Induced Fit model
- Enzyme active site changes shape slightly to allow the substrate to bind to it  
- Active site puts stresses on the substrate, causing bonds to brake  
- Reaction is catalysed, causing the product(s) to be released  
- Enzymes are only able to have 1 substrate fit it – amylase only catalyses starch (hydrolysis)  
- Enzyme concentration – a higher concentration will cause the substrate to be broken down faster. The rate of reaction will plateau as the substrate concentration decreases, as collisions are less likely to occur  
![Induced fit model of enzyme action](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/74820599/111035609-254d4c80-8413-11eb-836f-a922b27679ff.png)[^3]  

:::note Substrate Concentration  
higher concentration of substrate means that the enzymes are more likely to collide with substrate. Increase rate of reaction, to a point. Once all of the enzyme has substrate in active site, reaction cannot continue further  
:::
:::note Inhibitor Concentration  
higher concentration of competitive inhibitors will cause reaction to slow, as more competitive inhibitor blocks active sites Non-competitive inhibitors will have an impact, however it is not based on concentration as they do not block the active site  
:::
- pH – outside of the enzymes optimum pH, the active site denatures quickly. This prevents the reaction from being catalysed  
- Temperature – below the optimum temperature, the reaction slows, as less energy to cause collisions  
:::note Key Point  
Above optimum temp – reaction stops – enzymes denature  
:::  

## Nucleic Acids
- DNA – deoxyribonucleic acid  
- RNA – ribonucleic acid  
- Genetic material for living organisms  
- Adenine (purine), Thymine / Uracil (pyramidal), Guanine (purine), Cytosine (pyramidal)  
### Semi-Conservative Replication  

- DNA unzips: DNA Helicase  
- Base pairs move in between the unzipped strands  
- DNA Polymerase used to bind the new bases to the old strands  
- Forms 2 DNA strands, each with 1 old strand and 1 new strand  

### Proof for semi-conservative replication  
- DNA replicated until all Nitrogen is 15N – this is heavier, causing the strand to be lower in solution  
- DNA then replicated 1 generation with 14N – this creates a hybrid DNA, with 50% 15N and 50% 14N  
- DNA replicated 1 further generation in 14N solution – creating DNA with 25% 15N and 75% 14N  
- This is repeated, eventually forming DNA only containing 14N  
- The solution can be centrifuged, DNA containing different Nitrogen isotopes to be identified

## ATP – Adenosine Triphosphate
- Used to transfer energy within cells  
- Made of: Adenine, 3× Phosphate groups, Ribose sugar  
- 𝐴𝑇𝑃 + 𝐻2𝑂 → 𝐴𝐷𝑃 + 𝑃𝑖 – condensation on ATP, forming ADP and a phosphate group; breaking the bond releases energy  
- Low activation energy, so it is easy to release energy  
:::note ATPase  
enzyme catalysing hydrolysis of ATP (breaks down ATP into ADP)  
:::
- Photophosphorylation  
	o Photosynthesis: Plants only, Using light to synthesise ADP → ATP  
- Oxidative Phosphorylation  
	o Using respiration to synthesise ADP → ATP; Plants and Animals  
- Substrate-level Phosphorylation  
	o When phosphate groups are transferred from donors; plants and animals  
### Uses of ATP  
- Metabolic Processes – provides energy to build up molecules from subunits  
- Movement – energy is required for muscular contraction  
- Active Transport – movement of molecules against a concentration gradient  
- Secretion – ATP is needed to form lysosomes to encase cell products  
- Activation of Molecules – inorganic phosphate released in hydrolysis of ATP can phosphorylate other molecules

## Water  
- Essential for all living organisms  
- Polar Molecule  
	o Hydrogen bonds between water molecules require lots of energy to break  
	o Causes water to have a high surface tension  
- Solvent  
	o As water is polar, other polar molecules are able to dissolve in it  
	o Ionic compounds are surrounded by water molecules when dissolved  
	o Allows gases to be dissolved – CO2, O2, NH3…  
- High Specific Heat Capacity  
	o A lot of energy is required to increase the temperature by 1° - this is due to the strength of the hydrogen bonds  
	o This means that water acts as a buffer, reducing temperature fluctuations  
- High Latent Heat of Vaporisation  
	o A lot of energy is required to evaporate water (into steam)  
	o Ideal for cooling an organism – sweating (animals) or transpiring (plants)  
- Cohesion between Molecules  
	o High surface tension means that column of water is able to be pulled up a vessel (such as a xylem)  
- Metabolite  
	o Used in condensation / hydrolysis reactions to break / form bonds  

## Inorganic Ions  
- Occur in solution in the cytoplasm / bodily fluids  
- Some are in high concentrations, others in low concentrations  
- Each ion has a specific role  
- Iron ions Haemoglobin  
- Sodium ions Co-transport of Glucose and Amino Acids  
- Phosphate ions Part of DNA and ATP  

## Benedict’s Test for Reducing Sugars  
- Add 2cm3 of Benedict’s reagent to 5cm3 of homogenised food sample  
- Heat in gently boiling water bath for 5 mins  
- Observe colour change:  
	o Negative – blue  
	o Positive – Green (lowest concentration) → Brick red (highest concentration)  
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/74820599/111036521-86771f00-8417-11eb-9382-ab6cc16ec824.png)[^6]

## Benedict’s Test for Non-Reducing Sugars  
- Carry out Benedict’s test as above  
- If result is negative:  
	o Boil homogenised food sample in acid for 5 mins  
	o Neutralise with sodium hydrogen carbonate powder  
	o Carry out Benedict’s test again, as above  

## Iodine Test for Starch  
- Add a few drops of iodine in potassium iodide solution to the food sample  
- Observe colour change  
	o Yellow / orange (no change) – no starch is present  
	o Blue / black – starch is present  

## Emulsion Test for Lipids  
- Add 2cm3 of homogenised food sample to 2cm3 of ethanol  
- Shake, then add some water  
- Observe whether an emulsion forms (emulsion present = lipids present)
