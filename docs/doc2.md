## Monomers and Polymers
- Monomers
    o Smaller units from larger polymers are made from
- Polymers
	o Molecules made from a large number of monomers joined together
- Condensation reactions
	o Join monomers together into larger molecules, releasing water
	o Monosaccharides → Disaccharides → Polysaccharides: glycosidic bonds formed
	o Amino acids → Polypeptides: peptide bonds
	o Glycerol + fatty acids → Triglycerides: ester bonds
- Condensation reactions
	o Break down molecules, by using water
## Carbohydrates
- Made up of monosaccharides (monomers of carbohydrates)
- Common monosaccharides - glucose, galactose, fructose
- Disaccharides
	o Formed by condensation reaction of 2 monosaccharides
	o Maltose → Glucose + Glucose
	o Sucrose → Glucose + Fructose
	o Lactose → Glucose + Galactose
### Two Isomers:
α-glucose: Carbon atom 1 has hydrogen pointing up, and hydroxyl group pointing down
β-glucose: Carbon atom 1 has hydrogen and hydroxyl groups flipped

- Polysaccharides
	o Formed by condensation of many monosaccharides
	o Glycogen → condensation of α-glucose
	o Starch → condensation of α-glucose
	o Cellulose → condensation of β-glucose
- Structure of Glycogen
	o Energy store in animals
	o Highly branched structure, coiled – so compact
	o Unable to diffuse out of cells, so stays where it is needed until energy is required
- Structure of Cellulose
	o Unbranched, linear chains
	o Used in plant cell wall – provides rigidity to plants
	o Fibres group together to form microfibrils – hydrogen bonds (strength in large numbers)
- Structure of Starch
	o Forms granules – unable to move out of cells it is formed in – doesn’t have to diffuse far, so reasonably quick access to energy
	o Branched chains, coiled – compact
