:::note Definition
Polymer -- molecules made from a large number of monomers joined together

Condensation Reactions  
- Join monomers together into larger molecules, releasing water  
- Monosaccharides → Disaccharides → Polysaccharides: glycosidic bonds formed  
- Amino acids → Polypeptides: peptide bonds  
- Glycerol + fatty acids → Triglycerides: ester bonds  
:::  
:::note Definition
Condensation Reaction  
Break down larger molecules, using water
:::  

## Carbohydrates  
- Made up of monosaccharides (monomers of carbohydrates)  
- Common monosaccharides - glucose, galactose, fructose  
- Disaccharides  
	o Formed by condensation reaction of 2 monosaccharides  
	o Maltose → Glucose + Glucose  
	o Sucrose → Glucose + Fructose  
	o Lactose → Glucose + Galactose  
### Two Isomers:  
α-glucose: Carbon atom 1 has hydrogen pointing up, and hydroxyl group pointing down  
β-glucose: Carbon atom 1 has hydrogen and hydroxyl groups flipped

- Polysaccharides  
	o Formed by condensation of many monosaccharides  
	o Glycogen → condensation of α-glucose  
	o Starch → condensation of α-glucose  
	o Cellulose → condensation of β-glucose  
- Structure of Glycogen  
	o Energy store in animals  
	o Highly branched structure, coiled – so compact  
	o Unable to diffuse out of cells, so stays where it is needed until energy is required  
- Structure of Cellulose  
	o Unbranched, linear chains  
	o Used in plant cell wall – provides rigidity to plants  
	o Fibres group together to form microfibrils – hydrogen bonds (strength in large numbers)  
- Structure of Starch  
	o Forms granules – unable to move out of cells it is formed in – doesn’t have to diffuse far, so reasonably quick access to energy  
	o Branched chains, coiled – compact
	
## Lipids  
- Triglycerides  
	o Glycerol + 3 fatty acid tails  
	o Form oils, waxes, fats  
	o Hydrophobic – do not mix with water  
- Phospholipids  
	o Form the cell wall – phospholipid bilayer  
	o Phosphate + glycerol + 2 fatty acid tails  
	o Polar molecules – phosphate head is hydrophilic (water loving) // fatty acid tails are hydrophobic (water hating)  
- Fatty acids  
	o Saturated – all carbon atoms have single bonds – with the maximum number of hydrogens possible  
	o Unsaturated  
:::tip Key Point
**Monounsaturated**  
	1 pair of carbon atoms have a double bond  
	removes 2 hydrogens, causing a kink in the chain  
:::  
:::tip Key Point
**Polyunsaturated**  
	more than 1 pair of carbon atoms have a double bond  
	removes more than 2 hydrogens  
	causes many kinks in the chain  
	have less energy than unsaturated fatty acids

## Proteins  
- Made up of amino acids  
- Amine group: NH2 Carboxyl group: COOH  
- R group – the side chain causing the amino acid to be unique  
- Dipeptides – condensation of two amino acids  
- Polypeptides – condensation of many amino acids  
- Proteins can be made up of multiple polypeptide chains  
:::note Primary Structure
order of amino acids – polypeptide chain  
:::  
:::note Secondary Structure
α-helix or β-pleated sheet – formed by hydrogen bonds between R-groups  
:::  
:::note Tertiary Structure
further coiling of α-helix / β-pleated sheet – more compact  
:::
:::note Quaternary Structure
linking together of multiple tertiary structure polypeptide chains  
:::   
- Hydrogen bonds – hold together the polypeptide chains in quaternary structure  
- Ionic bonds – join together amino acids into polypeptide chain  
- Disulphide bridges – strong bonds between R-groups holding α-helix / β-pleated sheet together

## Enzymes  
- Lower the activation energy of the reaction it catalyses  
- Lock and Key model of enzyme action  
	o Substrate fits perfectly in the enzyme  
	o No explanation as to how the enzyme catalyses the reaction

- Induced Fit model of enzyme action  
	o Enzyme active site changes shape slightly to allow the substrate to bind to it  
	o Active site puts stresses on the substrate, causing bonds to brake  
	o Reaction is catalysed, causing the product(s) to be released  
- Enzymes are only able to have 1 substrate fit it – amylase only catalyses starch (hydrolysis)  
- Enzyme concentration – a higher concentration will cause the substrate to be broken down faster. The rate of reaction will plateau as the substrate concentration decreases, as collisions are less likely to occur  
![Induced fit model of enzyme action](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/74820599/111035609-254d4c80-8413-11eb-836f-a922b27679ff.png)[^3]  

- Substrate concentration – higher concentration of substrate means that the enzymes are more likely to collide with substrate. Increase rate of reaction, to a point. Once all of the enzyme has substrate in active site, reaction cannot continue further  
- Inhibitor concentration – higher concentration of competitive inhibitors will cause reaction to slow, as more competitive inhibitor blocks active sites Non-competitive inhibitors will have an impact, however it is not based on concentration as they do not block the active site  
- pH – outside of the enzymes optimum pH, the active site denatures quickly. This prevents the reaction from being catalysed  
- Temperature – below the optimum temperature, the reaction slows, as less energy to cause collisions  
:::note Key Point  
Above optimum temp – reaction stops – enzymes denature  
:::  

## Nucleic Acids
- DNA – deoxyribonucleic acid  
- RNA – ribonucleic acid  
- Genetic material for living organisms  
- Adenine (purine), Thymine / Uracil (pyramidal), Guanine (purine), Cytosine (pyramidal)  
#### Semi-Conservative Replication  

- DNA unzips: DNA Helicase  
- Base pairs move in between the unzipped strands  
- DNA Polymerase used to bind the new bases to the old strands  
- Forms 2 DNA strands, each with 1 old strand and 1 new strand  

#### Proof for semi-conservative replication  
- DNA replicated until all Nitrogen is 15N – this is heavier, causing the strand to be lower in solution  
- DNA then replicated 1 generation with 14N – this creates a hybrid DNA, with 50% 15N and 50% 14N  
- DNA replicated 1 further generation in 14N solution – creating DNA with 25% 15N and 75% 14N  
- This is repeated, eventually forming DNA only containing 14N  
- The solution can be centrifuged, DNA containing different Nitrogen isotopes to be identified
