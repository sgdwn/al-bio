## Monomers and Polymers  
:::note
Monomer -- the smaller subunits making up larger polymers
:::
:::note
Polymer -- molecules made from a large number of monomers joined together

Condensation Reactions  
- Join monomers together into larger molecules, releasing water  
- Monosaccharides → Disaccharides → Polysaccharides: glycosidic bonds formed  
- Amino acids → Polypeptides: peptide bonds  
- Glycerol + fatty acids → Triglycerides: ester bonds

Condensation Reaction  
Break down larger molecules, using water

## Carbohydrates  
- Made up of monosaccharides (monomers of carbohydrates)  
- Common monosaccharides - glucose, galactose, fructose  
- Disaccharides  
	o Formed by condensation reaction of 2 monosaccharides  
	o Maltose → Glucose + Glucose  
	o Sucrose → Glucose + Fructose  
	o Lactose → Glucose + Galactose  
### Two Isomers:  
α-glucose: Carbon atom 1 has hydrogen pointing up, and hydroxyl group pointing down  
β-glucose: Carbon atom 1 has hydrogen and hydroxyl groups flipped

- Polysaccharides  
	o Formed by condensation of many monosaccharides  
	o Glycogen → condensation of α-glucose  
	o Starch → condensation of α-glucose  
	o Cellulose → condensation of β-glucose  
- Structure of Glycogen  
	o Energy store in animals  
	o Highly branched structure, coiled – so compact  
	o Unable to diffuse out of cells, so stays where it is needed until energy is required  
- Structure of Cellulose  
	o Unbranched, linear chains  
	o Used in plant cell wall – provides rigidity to plants  
	o Fibres group together to form microfibrils – hydrogen bonds (strength in large numbers)  
- Structure of Starch  
	o Forms granules – unable to move out of cells it is formed in – doesn’t have to diffuse far, so reasonably quick access to energy  
	o Branched chains, coiled – compact
