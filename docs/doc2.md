## Monomers and Polymers  
:::note Definition
Monomer -- the smaller subunits making up larger polymers

:::note Definition
Polymer -- molecules made from a large number of monomers joined together

Condensation Reactions  
- Join monomers together into larger molecules, releasing water  
- Monosaccharides → Disaccharides → Polysaccharides: glycosidic bonds formed  
- Amino acids → Polypeptides: peptide bonds  
- Glycerol + fatty acids → Triglycerides: ester bonds

Condensation Reaction  
Break down larger molecules, using water

## Carbohydrates  
- Made up of monosaccharides (monomers of carbohydrates)  
- Common monosaccharides - glucose, galactose, fructose  
- Disaccharides  
	o Formed by condensation reaction of 2 monosaccharides  
	o Maltose → Glucose + Glucose  
	o Sucrose → Glucose + Fructose  
	o Lactose → Glucose + Galactose  
### Two Isomers:  
α-glucose: Carbon atom 1 has hydrogen pointing up, and hydroxyl group pointing down  
β-glucose: Carbon atom 1 has hydrogen and hydroxyl groups flipped

- Polysaccharides  
	o Formed by condensation of many monosaccharides  
	o Glycogen → condensation of α-glucose  
	o Starch → condensation of α-glucose  
	o Cellulose → condensation of β-glucose  
- Structure of Glycogen  
	o Energy store in animals  
	o Highly branched structure, coiled – so compact  
	o Unable to diffuse out of cells, so stays where it is needed until energy is required  
- Structure of Cellulose  
	o Unbranched, linear chains  
	o Used in plant cell wall – provides rigidity to plants  
	o Fibres group together to form microfibrils – hydrogen bonds (strength in large numbers)  
- Structure of Starch  
	o Forms granules – unable to move out of cells it is formed in – doesn’t have to diffuse far, so reasonably quick access to energy  
	o Branched chains, coiled – compact
	
## Lipids  
- Triglycerides  
	o Glycerol + 3 fatty acid tails  
	o Form oils, waxes, fats  
	o Hydrophobic – do not mix with water  
- Phospholipids  
	o Form the cell wall – phospholipid bilayer  
	o Phosphate + glycerol + 2 fatty acid tails  
	o Polar molecules – phosphate head is hydrophilic (water loving) // fatty acid tails are hydrophobic (water hating)  
- Fatty acids  
	o Saturated – all carbon atoms have single bonds – with the maximum number of hydrogens possible  
	o Unsaturated  
:::tip Key Point
**Monounsaturated**
	1 pair of carbon atoms have a double bond
	removes 2 hydrogens, causing a kink in the chain
:::  
:::tip Key Point
**Polyunsaturated**
	more than 1 pair of carbon atoms have a double bond
	removes more than 2 hydrogens
	causes many kinks in the chain
	have less energy than unsaturated fatty acids

## Proteins  
- Made up of amino acids  
- Amine group: NH2 Carboxyl group: COOH  
- R group – the side chain causing the amino acid to be unique  
- Dipeptides – condensation of two amino acids  
- Polypeptides – condensation of many amino acids  
- Proteins can be made up of multiple polypeptide chains  
- Primary structure: order of amino acids – polypeptide chain  
- Secondary structure: α-helix or β-pleated sheet – formed by hydrogen bonds between R-groups  
- Tertiary structure: further coiling of α-helix / β-pleated sheet – more compact  
- Quaternary structure: linking together of multiple tertiary structure polypeptide chains  
- Hydrogen bonds – hold together the polypeptide chains in quaternary structure  
- Ionic bonds – join together amino acids into polypeptide chain  
- Disulphide bridges – strong bonds between R-groups holding α-helix / β-pleated sheet together
