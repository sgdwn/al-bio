## Eukaryotic Cells  
- Found in plants, animals + fungi  
- Have membrane bound nucleus / organelles  
- Cell membrane – phospholipid bilayer – fatty acid tails in, phosphate heads out  
- Nucleus – contains the cells genetic information  
	o Nucleolus – membrane within nucleus containing the DNA strands  
	o Nucleoplasm – the jelly-like substance filling the nucleus

- Mitochondria – releases energy – contains ribosomes and genetic material  
	o Matrix – the fluid filling the inside of the mitochondria  
	o Cristae – the folds in the internal membrane of the mitochondria

- Chloroplasts – convert sunlight into sugar for plants and algae  
	o Grana – the membrane-bound organelles containing the chlorophyll  
	o Thylakoid – a stack of grana

- Golgi apparatus – the organelle transporting, packaging, and processing protein  
	o Like a ‘stack of pitta breads’

- Lysosomes – releases lysozymes  
	o To allow the cell to break down old / dead cells, to allow the cell to replace them  
- Ribosomes – the site of protein production  
- Endoplasmic reticulum – membranous tubules in cytoplasm of eukaryotic cells  
	o Rough ER – ribosomes on cisternae (membrane-enclosed sacs), protein synthesis  
	o Smooth ER – involved in synthesis of lipids / protein transport

:::note Cell Wall
only found in plants, algea, fungi  
made of cellulose (plants), and chitin (fungi)  
:::
:::note Cell Vacuole  
found in plants  
offers support and rigidity to plants by making them turgid
