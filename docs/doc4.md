## Eukaryotic Cells  
- Found in plants, animals + fungi  
- Have membrane bound nucleus / organelles  
- Cell membrane – phospholipid bilayer – fatty acid tails in, phosphate heads out  
### Nucleus
- Contains the cells genetic information  
	o Nucleolus – membrane within nucleus containing the DNA strands  
	o Nucleoplasm – the jelly-like substance filling the nucleus

### Mitochondria
- Releases energy – contains ribosomes and genetic material  
	o Matrix – the fluid filling the inside of the mitochondria  
	o Cristae – the folds in the internal membrane of the mitochondria

### Chloroplasts
- Convert sunlight into sugar for plants and algae  
	o Grana – the membrane-bound organelles containing the chlorophyll  
	o Thylakoid – a stack of grana

### Golgi Apparatus
- The organelle responsible for transporting, packaging, and processing protein  
	o Like a ‘stack of pitta breads’

### Lysosomes
- Releases lysozymes  
	o To allow the cell to break down old / dead cells, to allow the cell to replace them  

### Ribosomes
- The site of protein production 

### Endoplasmic Reticulum
- Membranous tubules in cytoplasm of eukaryotic cells  
	o Rough ER – ribosomes on cisternae (membrane-enclosed sacs), protein synthesis  
	o Smooth ER – involved in synthesis of lipids / protein transport

:::note Cell Wall
only found in plants, algea, fungi  
made of cellulose (plants), and chitin (fungi)  
:::
:::note Cell Vacuole  
found in plants  
offers support and rigidity to plants by making them turgid

## Prokaryotic Cells + Viruses  
- Much smaller than eukaryotic cells  
- Cytoplasm lacks membrane bound organelles  
- Smaller ribosomes (70S instead of 80S)  
- No nucleus – single circular DNA molecules, free in the cytoplasm  
- Cell wall – made of murein – a glycoprotein  
- May also have:  
	o Plasmids – circular rings of DNA that bacteria can exchange with other bacteria  
	o Capsule –  slime layer on outside of bacteria, allowing bacteria to stick together
	o Flagella – used by the cell to move

- Viruses – acellular (cannot form multicellular organisms), non-living (cannot reproduce)  
	o Genetic material – not in a nucleus  
	o Capsid – the protein shell surrounding the virus  
	o Attachment protein – the protein that attaches the virus to the host

## Methods of Studying Cells  
- Optical (light) microscopes – max 1 500x magnification, use light to magnify small details  
- Transmission Electron Microscopes – TEM; fire a beam of electrons through a thin cross-section of cells. Shows internal (2D) structure of cell. Highest magnification / resolution Must be dead – vacuum required to allow electrons to travel a reasonable distance  
- Scanning Electron Microscope – SEM; fire electrons at cells, producing a 3D image of the cell. High magnification / resolution  
:::note Magnification  
the ability to increase the size of an object  
:::
:::note Resolution  
the minimum distance between two objects close together, that can still be discerned  
:::
- $magnification=\frac{size\;of\;image}{size\;of\;real\;object}$  
- Cell fractionation + ultracentrifugation  
	o Cut up tissue sample in ice cold water + buffer solution  
	o Homogenise - break down whole cells  
	o Filter - remove any debris + whole cells  
	o Spin (low speed) - nuclei  
	o Spin (higher speed)  
	o Spin (higher speed)  
	o …  
	o Spin (highest speed) - ribosomes  
- Iodine in potassium iodide solution can be used to identify starch granules  
- Artefacts – a change that is visible through a microscope, that isn’t meant to be there  
	o Could be caused by damage to the cells, or something on a lens
