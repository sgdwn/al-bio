## Eukaryotic Cells  
- Found in plants, animals + fungi  
- Have membrane bound nucleus / organelles  
- Cell membrane – phospholipid bilayer – fatty acid tails in, phosphate heads out  
### Nucleus
- Contains the cells genetic information  
	o Nucleolus – membrane within nucleus containing the DNA strands  
	o Nucleoplasm – the jelly-like substance filling the nucleus

### Lysosomes
- Releases lysozymes  
	o To allow the cell to break down old / dead cells, to allow the cell to replace them  

### Ribosomes
- The site of protein production 

### Endoplasmic Reticulum
- Membranous tubules in cytoplasm of eukaryotic cells  
	o Rough ER – ribosomes on cisternae (membrane-enclosed sacs), protein synthesis  
	o Smooth ER – involved in synthesis of lipids / protein transport

## Prokaryotic Cells + Viruses  
- Much smaller than eukaryotic cells  
- Cytoplasm lacks membrane bound organelles  
- Smaller ribosomes (70S instead of 80S)  
- No nucleus – single circular DNA molecules, free in the cytoplasm  
- Cell wall – made of murein – a glycoprotein  
- May also have:  
	o Plasmids – circular rings of DNA that bacteria can exchange with other bacteria  
	o Capsule –  slime layer on outside of bacteria, allowing bacteria to stick together
	o Flagella – used by the cell to move

- Viruses – acellular (cannot form multicellular organisms), non-living (cannot reproduce)  
	o Genetic material – not in a nucleus  
	o Capsid – the protein shell surrounding the virus  
	o Attachment protein – the protein that attaches the virus to the host

## Methods of Studying Cells  
- Optical (light) microscopes – max 1 500x magnification, use light to magnify small details  
- Transmission Electron Microscopes – TEM; fire a beam of electrons through a thin cross-section of cells. Shows internal (2D) structure of cell. Highest magnification / resolution Must be dead – vacuum required to allow electrons to travel a reasonable distance  
- Scanning Electron Microscope – SEM; fire electrons at cells, producing a 3D image of the cell. High magnification / resolution  
:::note Magnification  
the ability to increase the size of an object  
:::
:::note Resolution  
the minimum distance between two objects close together, that can still be discerned  
:::
- $magnification=\frac{size\;of\;image}{size\;of\;real\;object}$  
- Cell fractionation + ultracentrifugation  
	o Cut up tissue sample in ice cold water + buffer solution  
	o Homogenise - break down whole cells  
	o Filter - remove any debris + whole cells  
	o Spin (low speed) - nuclei  
	o Spin (higher speed)  
	o Spin (higher speed)  
	o …  
	o Spin (highest speed) - ribosomes  
- Iodine in potassium iodide solution can be used to identify starch granules  
- Artefacts – a change that is visible through a microscope, that isn’t meant to be there  
	o Could be caused by damage to the cells, or something on a lens  

## Cell Replication
- Eukaryotic cells with the ability to divide have a cell cycle  
- DNA replication occurs during interphase  
- Mitosis – the part of the cell cycle where an eukaryotic cell divides  
	o Prophase - 
	o Metaphase - 
	o Anaphase - 
	o Telophase - 
	o Cytokinesis - where the cell splits in two  
- Mitosis is a controlled process  
	o Uncontrolled cell division can lead to cancer  
	o Some cancer treatments are aimed at preventing cell division  
- Binary fission – cell replication in prokaryotes  
	o Replication of circular DNA + plasmids  
	o Cytoplasm divides, producing 2 daughter cells  
- Viruses  
	o Do not undergo cell division  
	o Instead, invade a host cell, hijacking its’ reproductive mechanisms  
	
## Transport Across Membranes  
### Diffusion  
- Net movement of particles from an area of high concentration to an area of low concentration  
- Passive - does not use ATP  
- Facilitated Diffusion  
	o Water-soluble compounds cannot diffuse through cell membrane  
	o Instead, they use a carrier / channel protein to diffuse into the cell  
	o Carrier protein  
		▪ Molecule binds to protein, changes shape, and is able to move into the cytoplasm  
		▪ Specific – each carrier protein is only able to transport 1 type of molecule  
	o Channel protein  
		▪ Molecule is able to pass through a ‘channel’ in the cell membrane  
		▪ Specific – each channel protein is only able to transport  
- Simple Diffusion  
	o Net movement of particles  
	o Phospholipid bilayer only allows lipid-soluble molecules to pass through  
	o Water soluble molecules have to use a carrier protein to pass through  
  
### Osmosis  
- Movement of water across a partially permeable membrane from a less concentrated solution to a more concentrated solution  
- Passive - does not use ATP  
- Tries to make the water potential the same on both sides of a partially permeable membrane  
  
### Active Transport  
- Transport of molecules against the concentration gradient, using ATP (energy)  

### Co-Transport  
- Where a molecule is pulled through, into a cell, using an ion  
- Carrier proteins  
	- ATP is hydrolysed in the carrier protein, producing ADP (adenosine diphosphate)  
	- The carrier protein pumps out all of a certain ion, creating a low concentration - this causes that ion to diffuse into the cell  
	- An ion may bind to the carrier protein, which helps ‘drag’ the larger molecule through, against the concentration gradient  
- Example - Sodium ions and Glucose  
	- Some glucose will remain in the ileum (intestine) during digestion, as the concentration is equal on both sides of the membrane  
	- Co-transport can be used to move more of the glucose into the cell  
	- All of the sodium is pumped out of the protein, into the bloodstream - this creates a lower concentration  
	- A sodium ion binds to the co-transporter protein, dragging a glucose molecule through, into the protein. These are then pumped out of the cell  
  
## Fick’s Law  
𝑟𝑎𝑡𝑒 𝑜𝑓 𝑑𝑖𝑓𝑓𝑢𝑠𝑖𝑜𝑛 = 𝑠𝑢𝑟𝑓𝑎𝑐𝑒 𝑎𝑟𝑒𝑎 × 𝑐𝑜𝑛𝑐𝑒𝑛𝑡𝑟𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛 𝑑𝑖𝑓𝑓𝑒𝑟𝑒𝑛𝑐𝑒/𝑡ℎ𝑖𝑐𝑘𝑛𝑒𝑠𝑠 𝑜𝑓 𝑚𝑒𝑚𝑏𝑟𝑎𝑛𝑒  
  
## Cell Membrane  
:::note Phospholipid Bilayer
made up of phospholipids, in a bilayer, allowing lipid-soluble substances to enter / leave a cell  
:::
:::note Plasma Membrane
membranes around + within cells, having the same basic structure as the phospholipid bilayer
:::
  
### Proteins  
Extrinsic – on the surface of the membrane, or partially embedded in the membrane  
Intrinsic – completely span the bilayer  

### Functions of Proteins  
1. Transport in and out of cells - carrier proteins – facilitated diffusion – active transport - channel proteins  
2. Receptors - for homones - for neurotransmitters  
3. Antigens - for cell recognition  
4. Structural Support - to give the membrane a stronger structure  
5. Help cells adhere together - to create tissues  
6. Digestive enzymes - in epithelial cells in the intestine, enzymes are embedded in the membrane ------ this helps create a higher concentration gradient around the transporter protein    
:::note Fluid Mosaic  
phospholipid bilayer – very flexible (fluid); many proteins, different sizes + shapes + phospholipids (mosaic)  
:::

## The Immune System  
### Important Components  
**Thymus Gland** – produced t-lymphocytes (which discriminate between self and non-self antigens)  
**Bone Marrow** – b-lymphocyte production (differentiate from bone marrow → discriminate between self and non-self antigens)  
**Lymph Nodes** – filter the lymph to remove pathogens; contain phagocytes, mature b- and t- cells  
**Spleen / Kidney** – filter the blood to remove antigens  
**Tonsils** – remove antigens in the lymph, protect the respiratory system  
### Phagocytosis  
1. Phagocytes are attracted by chemotaxis towards the pathogen  
2. Receptors on the membrane of the phagocyte recognise antigens on the pathogen  
3. Pathogen is engulfed, forming a vesicle (phagosome)  
4. Lysosomes fuse with the phagosome  
5. Digestive enzymes in the lysosome hydrolyse the ingested bacteria, killing it  
  
### The Inflammatory Response  
1. Pathogens enter a wound  
2. Platelets release blood clotting agents at the damaged site  
3. MAST cells secrete FACTORS, increasing vasodilation, and vascular constriction (reducing blood supply to the affected areas)  
4. Neutrophils secrete FACTORS that kill pathogens  
5. Neutrophils and macrophages remove the pathogens by phagocytosis  
6. Macrophages secrete hormones called CYTOKININS, attracting more lymphocytes. This activates cells involved in tissue repair  
7. The inflammatory response continues until the pathogen is eliminated, and the wound repaired  
- Phagocytosis is a non-specific defence mechanism  
- Pathogens are digested by lysozyme enzymes in pathogens  
- Pathogens are destroys=ed by phagocytosis, as part of the inflammatory response  

## Antibodies  
:::note Antibody  
proteins on the exterior of a cell, allowing it to be identified  
:::  
### B-Cells in the Immune Response  
• Immature b-cells divide by mitosis before birth, in the bone marrow  
• Each b-cell matures (b = bone)  
• Maturation involves the production of receptor modules (which are expressed in the plasma membrane of the b-cell)  
• Each b-cell has a different receptor, each binds to a different antigen  
• Mature b-cells circulate and concentrate in the lymphoid tissue  
• By birth, there are millions of different b-cells, each with a specific receptor  
### Effector Phase  
1. T-helper cells have been activated  
2. T-helper cells then come in contact with b-cells, with the corresponding antigen  
3. T-cells bind to the surface of the b-cells, begin to secrete cytokines  
4. Cytokines stimulate b-cells to undergo clonal expansion (by mitosis), differentiate to plasma cells, then produce antibodies  

## Antibodies  
Y-shaped protein produced by b-lymphocytes (sometimes called b-cells)  
Work in 4 ways:  
- Agglutination – clumping  
• Clumps of bacterial cells are formed (due to 2 binding sites)  
• Phagocytes locate the pathogen more quickly  
- Opsonisation – coating  
• Coat the pathogen, allowing the phagocyte to find it more quickly  
- Lysis - digesting  
- Antitoxins – neutralisation of toxins  
### Antibody Transcription  
- Each lymphocyte will make different antibodies – each lymphocyte has different DNA  
- mRNA is different in each cell (due to different DNA)  
- Each polypeptide chain will be different (primary structure)  
- ∴ the antibodies each lymphocyte will make will be unique  

## HIV  
HIV positive – infected with HIV  
- Viruses often remain dormant in an infected persons’ body, leading to AIDS many years later  
- HIV causes the symptoms of AIDS  
- AIDS  
• Number of T-helper cells becomes very low  
• Immune system cannot stimulate B-cells to produce antibodies or cytotoxic T-cells, to kill infected cells  
• Making the person more likely to die from secondary infection  
### How does HIV replicate?  
1. Enters bloodstream  
2. Binds to CD4 antigen on T-helper cells  
3. Capsid and membrane fuse, inserting viruses RNA and enzymes into the host  
4. Viral reverse transcriptase enzymes convert RNA to DNA  
5. DNA is copied to make double stranded DNA  
6. DNA inserted into hosts’ chromosomes  
7. HIV DNA transcribed to mRNA, containing instructions for viral proteins and RNA  
8. mRNA passes out of nucleus, into ribosomes, translation occurs, forming new viral particles  
9. Viral particles bud from T-helper cells, surrounded by a bit of cell membrane, forming their lipid envelope  
10. New virus can then infect other cells  

## Antibiotics
- First discovered by Alexander Fleming, 1928, by accident
- Antibiotics are ineffective against viruses
• Viruses do not have cell walls
• Viruses lack metabolic pathways + cell structures
• Viruses are inside host cells, so antibiotics cannot reach them
### How do they work?
#### Osmotic Lysis
• Inhibit synthesis and assembly of peptidoglycans in bacterial cell walls
• Only work while bacteria are growing
• Penicillin works in this way
#### Preventing Reproduction
• Prevent DNA replication
• Prevent mRNA synthesis (transcription)
• Prevent transfer of amino acids to ribosomes (translation)
• Prevent protein synthesis

## Vaccination
- A weakened, killed, or attenuated, pathogen, administered to stimulate the production of antibodies
- Provide a level of immunity, reducing the likelihood of severe disease / death
### Endemic Diseases
• Diseases can remain endemic despite a vaccination programme
• Some people don’t develop immunity
• Vaccine may be administered after someone has been infected
• Pathogen has a high mutation frequency, so antigens change regularly
• There are too many variants / strains to vaccinate against
• Some pathogens disguise themselves (coat in self antigens, burrow into cells, in inaccessible places)
• Patients may object on religious, ethical, or social reasons (vaccine hesitancy)
### Features of a Successful Vaccination Programme
• Economical to make – few can be vaccinated if too expensive
• Few / no side effects – if it is too dangerous, patients are discouraged
• Production, storage, and transport need to be viable – it needs to reach patients safely
• Trained staff need to administer vaccine correctly – must be given correctly to be effective
• Most of the population needs to be vaccinated to offer herd immunity – preventing transmission through a community
### Antigenic Immunity
• Viruses like flu mutate quickly
• RNA is swapped between swine, avian, and human flus
• This allows antigens to keep changing, requiring immunity to be built after each reinfection
